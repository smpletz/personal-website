Professional website to showcase projects/qualifications

Welcome to my website's repository! My name is Sean Pletz and I'm a student at Indiana University studying Informatics with a focus on web and app development.  I enjoy working on apps in Xcode and making games in Unity, so check back here every once and a while to see what I've been up to!
